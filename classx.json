Haven't you been in the workshops?” I showed him my hands: they were covered with scratches and my fingers burne. “But I do not want to be a workman” I said. “Why not?” “I do not want to be neglected”.

And I'm going to tell you something you don't know: your school is about to be reorganized. You will shortly see great changes there, and the general standard of education will not be inferior to that at the Camille Guy College”. Did my uncle's arguments finally convince me? Not altogether perhaps. But my uncle Sekou and even my aunts added their advice to his, and so I stayed at the technical school."}
